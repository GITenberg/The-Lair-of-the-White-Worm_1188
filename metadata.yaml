description: Something evil is lurking under the ground in Diana' s Grove. Summoned
  by his great-uncle, Richard Salton, Adam Salton travels to Lesser Hill, Mercia,
  only to find himself surrounded by evil. Be it the Castra Regis' s mesmeric assault
  on Lilla Watford, a child' s mysterious wounds, the lady Arabella March' s murder
  of Oolanga, or the terrifying white worm that dwells in a pit in Arabella' s house,
  Adam must work quickly to save himself and the other inhabitants of the area.
